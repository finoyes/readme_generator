Snippet2README - AI-Powered README Generator

Transform minimal project descriptions into comprehensive, professional README files using AI.

 Overview

**Snippet2README** is an intelligent CLI tool that takes a simple one-sentence project description and generates a complete, well-structured README.md file. Perfect for developers who want to save time on documentation while maintaining professional standards.
The Problem
Writing good README files is time-consuming. You want to focus on coding, not formatting documentation.

The Solution
Describe your project in one sentence → Get a production-ready README in seconds.

   **AI-Powered Generation** - Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini/ollama for intelligent content creation
   **Interactive CLI** - User-friendly prompts guide you through the process
   **Smart File Scanning** - Automatically detects your tech stack from project files
   **Professional Structure** - Generates Title, Description, Features, Installation, Usage, and more
   **Clean Markdown** - Output is properly formatted and ready to commit
   **Flexible Usage** - Use interactively or programmatically in your scripts
   **Secure** - API keys stored safely in .env files
   **Fast & Cheap** - Uses efficient gpt-4o-mini/ollama model

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenAI API** (GPT-4o-mini)
- **Libraries:**
  - `openai` - API integration
  - `python-dotenv` - Environment management
  - `inquirer` - Interactive CLI prompts

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snippet2readme.git
cd snippet2readme
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

> **Get your API key:** Visit [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

 Usage

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)

Simply run the script and follow the prompts:

```bash
python snippet2readme.py
```

You'll be asked:
- Project name
- One-sentence description
- Primary programming language
- License type
- Whether to scan project files

**Example:**

from snippet2readme import ReadmeGenerator

generator = ReadmeGenerator()

readme = generator.generate_readme(
    description="A task tracker for students",
    project_name="StudentTaskFlow",
    language="Python",
    license_type="MIT"
)

generator.save_readme(readme, directory=".")
```

 Example Output

**Input:**
```
